# Godot Coding Challenge

## What is this?
This repo is a series of Godot projects inspired by the Coding Challenge series by [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw), the full playlist of which can be found here:

These projects intend to implement these challenges in a simple, Godot friendly way. As such, they are not going to be 100% identical to what is done in the source material - instead there will be things like slight optimizations, different implementations, and of course a completely different syntax.

Additionally, some of these challenges will be skipped, either due to not being possible or relevant, or because a more interesting challenge caught my attention. The numbering will stay the same to align with the playlist, which means that there will likely be holes in the numbering.

Finally, this repo may also have challenges inspired, but not neccesarily aligned to, the Coding Challenges playlist. They will be designated with a:

>XD#

which represents that it is a deviation, what challenge it is a deviation of, and which deviation it is.

## What is inside?
Each directory contains the source project (and all source code) and should contain a README file with a link to the Code Challenge it relates to. It may also contain helpful images, references, and videos, but it is recommended you watch the original Code Challenge video for a more detailed explanation of what is going on.

## How do I run these?
Each of the subdirectories is a standalone Godot project - you can check out the entire repo or just the individual challenge(s) that interest you. Boot up Godot, open the project, and hit Run!

### What version of Godot?
Unless otherwise stated, it can be assumed that the projects can run on the latest version of Godot, or can easily be updated to the latest version.

## Hey, I could do this better!
Probably. This isn't meant to be the pefect implementation, nor is it always going to be the best code to look at. I do try to clean everything up (and I typically try to write clean code when I'm programming) but there are going to be scripts and projects that get a bit messy. These challenges are for me as much as they are for anyone else, and showing what it takes to make something cool will be more useful than showing what it takes when you have a mature, finished project. That being said, always review your code and find ways to improve it - this is *prototype* code, not *production* code!

## Will you be making videos?
I would like to have my own series of Godot Coding Challenge videos that mirror the Coding Challenge playlist, but that will be time-permitting and I don't really have a great setup for it. However, I think it would be valuable to many new developers as it would provide better insight into how to work through projects like these, as well as give opportunities for better insights than what can be entered into a README file. Also, I'm really just not very good at making videos.

Any videos can be found in the [Godot Academy Coding Challenges](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOhO-3_UuMu2O6538XTOjp9T5cdDXlCin) playlist.
